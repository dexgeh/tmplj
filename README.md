#### tmplj

tmplj is a string based templating system, that aim to be lightweight and fast enough.
It does a simple translation to java source code, with compilation (requires tools.jar distributed with the jdk runtime) and runtime loading.

An example file can be seen in the test directory [example here](http://github.com/dexgeh/tmplj/blob/master/test/tmplj/test/test1.html).
